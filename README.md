# Tweet Comments Data Cleaner

This is my in-progress Twitter Comments Data Cleaner for a project I'm working on.

# Usage

To run the script, simply execute this comment

```bash
python clean.py
```

Arguments:

```bash
-h head: only clean the first 'head' number of items in the dataset
-s specific: clean a specific line of text in the dataset, count from 1
```
